# Distributed Systems Laboratories

To understand how distributed applications are developed guaranteeing non functional requirements such as reconfigurability, security, fault tolerance and scalability. Students should be able to define a distributed architecture for an application. To program distributed applications using remote procedure calls and distributed name services. To interpret security requirements, to be able to formulate policies and use mechanisms to fulfil such requirements. To analyse reliability and availability requirements, to introduce mechanisms for insuring fault tolerance in the applications.
