## About

To understand how distributed applications are developed guaranteeing non functional requirements such as reconfigurability, security, fault tolerance and scalability. Students should be able to define a distributed architecture for an application. To program distributed applications using remote procedure calls and distributed name services. To interpret security requirements, to be able to formulate policies and use mechanisms to fulfil such requirements. To analyse reliability and availability requirements, to introduce mechanisms for insuring fault tolerance in the applications.

## Program

**Introduction**: Reasons for developing distributed systems. Problems introduced by distribution. Historical evolution. Reference Architectures. Distributed Communication: Transport Level and corresponding APIÂ´s. Remote Procedure Calls. Object Distributed Systems. Web Services Naming Properties of names. Name management Systems. Directory Systems.Architecture of name services Security Security policies and mechanisms. Trusted computing base. Secure Channels. Introduction to cryptography symmetric key and asymmetrical key algorithms, key distribution. Authentication. Authorization. Integrity digital signatures. Web Services Security-Handlers Fault Tolerance Fault Model, reliability, availability. Policies for fault tolerance error recovery, error processing. Replication fault model, architecture, protocols. Distributed Transactions Message Queuing Asynchronous and Synchronous communication. Message Oriented Middleware. Java Messages, Analysis of available platforms Sun-RPC, CORBA, J2EE, Web services.

### Laboratories

#### Tools

* Using Maven to build Java projects
* Use Eclipse to program and debug Java projects
* Use sockets to transfer data between client and server

#### Sun RPC

* Distribute an originally centralized application using the SUN RPC
* Increase knowledge of RPC
